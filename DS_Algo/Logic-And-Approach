# TWO POINTER APPROACH

## 1. TWO SUM
If we are given a sorted array for which we need to find the pairs whose sum will be equal to a given target.
for example: 
numbers = [2, 7, 15, 11]
target = 9

we will take two pointers- left and right.
left = 0
right = len(numbers) - 1
while 
if numbers[left] + numbers[right] > target:
  # 2 + 11 = 13
  # 13 > 9
  
elif numbers[left] + numbers[right] < target:

else:
